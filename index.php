 <p> Hi everyone, my name is Dasha. Currently I am studying web design in pursuit of a web/UX development career. My path started back in the Bay Area where I got my A.A. in Marketing as well as a start in visual design at the Academy of Art. Now, I hope to learn all the fundamentals that will help me put my skills to work whether it's a start as an intern at a local company or making websites for people I know.
</p>
<p> This year, I hope to accomplish many things including doing my best with new concepts and putting my knowledge into practice. It will be very exciting to work with a real client to create and deploy a site that many people in the community will see.
